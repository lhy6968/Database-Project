# Database-Project
Hospitals plays an important role in peopleâ€™s daily life. It not only provides patients with treatment
services but also stores the records for further usages. These usages include inventory checking, accounting
auditing, anamnesis analyzing and others. To meet the mounting requirements of hospitals, a well-designed
database is crucial. (Griffith, J.R. & White, K. R., 2005) Beyond its function for treatment services and
records, the database also should perform efficient employee management. On one hand, hospitals need to
store employee information which includes his or her salary to determine the payload. On the other hand,
considering the treatment record of anamnesis, it is necessary to find which doctor offers the treatment and
which department should take responsibility for it. Therefore, in this project, we implement a database of a hospital.
